<h1>Currently Implemented</h1>

* Wave file type (struct)
* Opens waves and gets data like: num of channels, sample rate etc
* Copies audio to char array
* Calculate the amplitudes of samples
* Calculate Track Length (Basic)
* Generate spectogram (basically a test for me)

<h1>WIP</h1>

* Split up samples by channel instead of raw audio data (could use a better solution)

<h1>To Do</h1>

* add ncurses stuff
* Update C version
* Stop presuming data will be where its supposed to be and use the chunk sizes incase files have stuff in them 
* Stream from disk
* Create Branches for stuff
* Come up with a solution for playback
* Lots more
